# 🍄 HappyCaps Mushroom Farm

**Welcome to the GitHub home of HappyCaps — a small, independent urban mushroom farm based in the UK.**

We specialise in growing gourmet mushrooms like oyster and lion’s mane using sustainable, low-impact methods. Alongside our physical cultivation, we’re developing open-source tools, guides, and automation systems to support small-scale mushroom growers everywhere.

## 🌱 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub is where we share the behind-the-scenes of our farm tech and documentation, including:

- **📦 Grow Kit Instructions**  
  Clear, printable cultivation guides for our HappyCaps mushroom grow kits.

- **🧠 Myco-Automation Tools**  
  Code and schematics for Raspberry Pi-based systems that help us monitor and control temperature, humidity, and airflow in our fruiting chambers.

- **📝 Cultivation Notes**  
  Markdown templates and documentation to help others plan, track, and refine their own growing processes.

## 🍄 Our Ethos

HappyCaps is rooted in accessibility, sustainability, and a bit of mycological mischief. We're anti-corporate, pro-community, and believe that:

- Mushrooms should be grown, not gatekept.
- Tech should be open, adaptable, and low-cost.
- Knowledge should be shared — spores and all.

## 🤝 Want to Collaborate?

If you're:
- A small-scale grower looking to automate your setup,
- A developer or maker with a fungi fascination,
- Or just someone curious about mushrooms and DIY growing,

...feel free to open an issue, fork a project, or send us a message. We’re always happy to connect.
